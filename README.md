# Digital-Signal-Processing-for-EEG-signals
This repository contains code and resources for processing and analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques. It includes filtering, feature extraction, and visualization methods specifically designed for EEG data. The project leverages MATLAB/Simulink to perform key DSP tasks.
