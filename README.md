# Digital-Signal-Processing-for-EEG-signals
This repository contains code and resources for processing and analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques. It includes filtering, feature extraction, and visualization methods specifically designed for EEG data. The project leverages MATLAB/Simulink to perform key DSP tasks.

## Key Features:
- Preprocessing EEG signals to remove artifacts and noise
- Filtering techniques like band-pass, low-pass, and notch filters
- Extraction of important signal features (e.g., frequency bands, FFT)
- Visualization of EEG signals and extracted features
  
This repository serves as a resource for researchers, engineers, and students working in the field of neural signal processing.
